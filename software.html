    I have been involved in several software projects. Most notably I been a part of the
    C++ package, <a href="http://dogpack-code.org">DoGPack</a>. DoGPack is a C++ code
    for solving conservation and balance laws with a modal discontinuous Galerkin
    discretization. DoGPack is developed by James Rossmanith's research group, and most
    of my research has been as part of this project.

    <br />

    I also have a personal Python code,
    <a href="https://github.com/caleblogemann/pydogpack">PyDoGPack</a> which has grown
    quite extensive. I use this code to quickly prototype new ideas, to verify my
    research, and to closer examine the details of my numerics.

    <br />

    While I was working on my undergraduate degree which included a computer science major,
    I did an internship with a marketing and corporate data company,
    <a href="https://www.relationshipone.com">Relationship One</a>.
    As part of this internship, I worked in an Agile software developement environment
    to create Java based applications and manage a Node.js web server.

    <br />

    <strong>Software Philosophy</strong><br />
    I am passionate about well designed software. I am a believer in test driven
    developement as can be seen in these
    <a href="https://github.com/caleblogemann/pydogpack/tree/master/pydogpack/tests">tests</a>.
    I use version control extensively and have experience with Agile software developement.

    I also have experience with the following languages, where the links lead to an
    examples of my work in that language.
